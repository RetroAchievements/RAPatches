1. Once you have downloaded all parts of the patch, extract it using 
   WinRAR to a folder of your choice.

2. Now insert Xenogears USA Disc1 in your drive and launch CDRWin.

3. You will see the following window : CDRWin1, click the "Extract Disc"
   icon (in red on the picture).

4. Now you will see this window CDRWin2. Press the button right of the 
   image filename (in red on the picture), call the image "XenoCD1.bin" 
   (without quotes) and save it in the folder where you extracted the 
   patch files in step 1.

5. Then simply press the Start button on the bottom left of the CDRWin 
   window and wait until the image is extracted successfully.

6. Once done, remove Disc1 from your PC drive and insert Xenogears USA 
   Disc2.

7. Repeat steps 3-5 above but call the image "XenoCD2.bin" this time.

8. Once done, you should have the 2 images in the folder containing the 
   patch files: XenoCD1.bin (size 718'738'272 bytes) and XenoCD2.bin (size 
   688'700'880 bytes).

9. Almost done! Now execute "PatchCD1now!" (by double-clicking on it) and 
   wait for the patched image to be created (it can take several minutes 
   depending on your PC specs). Then when done, execute "PatchCD2now!" and 
   wait for the 2nd image to be created.

10. You now have 2 new files: XenoCD1patched.bin & XenoCD2patched.bin.

11. You can then launch your favorite burning tool (or CDRWin since you 
    have it installed by now) and burn those 2 images using the provided 
	.CUE files (XenoCD1patched.cue & XenoCD2patched.cue). You're done!
